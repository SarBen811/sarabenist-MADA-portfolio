Hello! Welcome to my coding website!

![](Picture%203.jpg){fig-align="center" width="369"}

## [Let me introduce myself]{.underline}

My name is [Sara Benist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-benist-47078517a/), and I graduated from the University of Georgia with a Master of Public Health degree concentrating in Epidemiology. After completing my undergraduate degree in Health Promotion from UGA, I served my community as an AmeriCorps VISTA member and leader during the COVID-19 pandemic for two years at the Georgia-based non-profit Helping Mamas before returning to school for my Master's degree.

With my BS in Health Promotion and MPH in Epidemiology, I have a background in fundamental epidemiology practices, writing professional papers including policy memos and meta-analyses, and other public health practices. I have fundamental knowledge in **SAS** and **Stata** through my Introductory Biostatistics and Epidemiology courses, and my **Foundations in R Coding** course provided a solid foundation in R and its related programs. I enjoy coding in R for the flexibility in the coding as well as the versatility and community of the programming language. With the MADA course, I built upon my coding knowledge and resources to perform data processing and analysis with confidence.

Fun fact: I was in the Redcoat Marching Band at UGA while I was an undergrad! Here I am waiting for the Rose Bowl Parade to start (it was an awesome *exhausting* day!)

## [Something I Find Cool]{.underline}

I'm sure everyone is at least a little curious about space (oceans on the other hand... they are a little scary!). For all that curiosity, so few people get to go into space and only a small fraction of people work with the final frontier! NASA has a program called the [Universe of Learning](https://universe-of-learning.org/home) that helps people learn about how their work is done and try to discover space themselves. Within the Universe of Learning, the [Exoplanet Watch](https://universe-of-learning.org/resources/projects/exoplanet-watch) asks volunteers to help map other solar systems by either collecting data using telescopes or performing data analyses to measure how many planets are in a solar system, their relative size, even if the center star has its own rotation. Very cool, and I think it would be an excellent class project for STEM classes to explore!
