# Hello! My name is Sara Benist. 

### Welcome to my webpage!

This website was created for my _Modern Applied Data Analysis class_ at the University of Georgia in Spring 2023. The course consisted of basic R coding, graphs and visualizations, and data analysis methods.


* Please use the `Menu Bar` above to look around. The *Projects* and *Flu Analysis* menus have examples of course content and R coding exercises.
* Have fun! All code and data sets can be downloaded at the GitHub repository linked on the banner.
* Contact me at scbenist@gmail.com for any questions.
